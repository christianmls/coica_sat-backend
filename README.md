# TypeScript DDD CoicaSat

For now, you have all the code example available in this other repository: https://github.com/christianmls/coica_sat-backend

The idea is that we'll move the basic parts (folder structure and bare minimum code to serve as skeleton) to this repository (`typescript-ddd-coica_sat`)
